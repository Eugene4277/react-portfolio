      <p className="lead">
        I'm sure that everybody who wants to be satisfied with their being
        should try a lot of branches to find themselves. And if you found your
        way always develop your skills and way of thinking. I've been working as
        php-developer for 8 month, after that I decided that I want to try
        another non IT branches, but finnaly I understood that coding is that
        thing which gives me a lot pleasure. I dicided to start from scratch and
        moved to Sillicon Valley. I spent there six month. I used to work with
        C, Python, and finnaly JavaScript. I understood that making user
        interfaces brings me a lot of fun, that's why I chose React. My friends
        invited me in their startup and I made frontend part of their website
        with Bootstrap and React. I'm still learning everyday, coding my pet
        projects, appling knowledges that I recieved for last half a year. But I
        want to improve my skills and get an experiance like a part of a team in
        a IT company...
